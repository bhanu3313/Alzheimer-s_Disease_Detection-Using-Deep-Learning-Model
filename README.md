This repository provides a deep learning-based solution for the early detection of Alzheimer's disease by analyzing medical imaging data. Utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the system aims to identify early signs of Alzheimer's from brain scans, offering the potential for earlier diagnosis and timely intervention.






Abstract:
Early detection of Alzheimer's disease is critical to improving the results of treatment as well as the quality of life of patients. This research explores the application of advanced machine learning algorithms in combination with neuroimaging data for the enhancement of precision in early-stage diagnosis of Alzheimer's. The three deep learning-based CNNs that we explicitly evaluate are VGG19, DenseNet, and SqueezeNet. VGG19 is known extensively for its feature extraction capabilities due to its deep architecture. DenseNet is designed with the aim of improving both feature reuse and gradient flow across its layers. Because SqueezeNet is concentrated on getting good results with lesser parameters, it can be used in low-resource scenarios.
This study exposes a wide range of brain MRI scans to the training process for these models and cross-compares their capacities for detecting early signs of Alzheimer's disease. It will be prime importance to prove which method is the most prudent at the early detection process by analyzing pros and cons of each model. Results would illustrate that from which model comes the best compromise towards efficiency and correctness. The above high-end research aims at developing some sophisticated diagnostic techniques to bring about positive differences in the approach taken towards early intervention for Alzheimer's patients. 




Results:
- VGG19 model achieved the highest accuracy at 83.2%, making it the best for Alzheimer's Disease diagnosis.
- VGG19 architecture consists of 19 layers, allowing it to capture complex and subtle features from MRI images.
- This model is particularly effective in identifying small changes in brain structure associated with Alzheimer's Disease.
- VGG19 outperformed DenseNet121 and SqueezeNet in performance metrics for Alzheimer's detection.
  - DenseNet121 is efficient but showed slightly lower accuracy and performance.
  - SqueezeNet prioritized efficiency but fell short in extracting detailed features compared to VGG19.
- VGG19's balance of depth and feature extraction contributed to its high accuracy in medical image analysis.
- The model is recommended for applications requiring excellent performance in the processing of medical images.
